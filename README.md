This repository contains all my contributions to the #TidyTuesday. Tidytuesday is a community activity where a new dataset is provided every week so that every participant can explore it and create a creative visualization of some aspect of the data.

**NBER Papers**

Contains information about papers published by the National Bureau of Economic Research between 1973 and 2021. I have seen a lot of barplot races on the internet and for this one, I tried creating one myself for the first time. It shows the number of publications an author has contributed to over the last decades.
