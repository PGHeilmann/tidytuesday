# tidytuesday

This repository contains all my contributions to the #tidytuesday. Tidytuesday is a community activity where a new dataset is provided every week so that every participant can explore it and create a creative visualization of some aspect of the data. More information and all datasets can be found in the official [Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/)
