**Ultra Trail Running**

This dataset contains data of thousands of runners participating in ultra trail races. These are races longer than a marathon. I was interested in the especially long races (>100 km) and how long it takes different runners to finish them. I rempved all races that had an uncommon distance and I removed all runners that did not finish a race.

**NBER Papers**

Contains information about papers published by the National Bureau of Economic Research between 1973 and 2021. I have seen a lot of barplot races on the internet and for this one, I tried creating one myself for the first time. It shows the number of publications an author has contributed to over the last decades.
